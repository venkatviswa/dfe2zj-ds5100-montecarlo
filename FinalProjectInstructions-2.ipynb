    "a Python module and accompanying files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module will implement a simple [Monte Carlo\n",
    "simulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) using a set\n",
    "of three related classes — a Die class, a Game class, and an Analyzer\n",
    "class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classes are related in the following way: Game objects are\n",
    "initialized with a Die object, and Analyzer objects are initialized with\n",
    "a Game object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[Die\\] &rarr; \\[Game\\] &rarr; \\[Analyzer\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simulator, a “die” can be any discrete random variable\n",
    "associated with a stochastic process, such as using a deck of card,\n",
    "flipping a coin, rolling an actual die, or speaking a language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is designed to integrate what you have learned in this class\n",
    "by calling upon the following areas of knowledge:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Basic syntax, expressions, and statements in Python.\n",
    "-   Python Classes with initialization methods.\n",
    "-   Data manipulation with NumPy and Pandas.\n",
    "-   Literate programming with docstrings and documentation.\n",
    "-   Unit testing with Unittest.\n",
    "-   Simple plotting with Pandas.\n",
    "-   Program modularization and packaging with Setuptools.\n",
